# coi - testing code generation

This project is a testbed for comparing the quality of code generated by different LLMs.

To run the tool have `ollama` and `jbang` installed.

For JBang see https://jbang.dev/download or run: 

`curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup`

Now just run:

`jbang coi.java` and the files in input will be processed and the results will be placed in output, under the name of model used.

To change model you can change it with:

`jbang --fresh -Dquarkus.langchain4j.ollama.chat-model.model-id=<model> coi.java`
